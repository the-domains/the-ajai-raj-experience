description: 'A mere minute shy of eleven in the morning on April the 2nd, in the year of their Lord 2016, I find myself in a most agreeable frame of mind, manic, it is true, but a mania I have managed to ride, with the grace of Ganesh who treads before me to smooth the path, as though it were a breaker and I surfer, instead of a dude who just kind of looks like he might know how to surf.'

A mere minute shy of eleven in the morning on April the 2nd, in the year of their Lord 2016, I find myself in a most agreeable frame of mind, manic, it is true, but a mania I have managed to ride, with the grace of Ganesh who treads before me to smooth the path, as though it were a breaker and I surfer, instead of a dude who just kind of looks like he might know how to surf.

And I find myself, indeed, trying out The Grid for the first time. Revolution? Flushing ninety-six bucks down the ol' crapper? Who knows? I've wasted more money on dumber things. 

The key moving forward is to settle on a name for my website--- "The Ajai Raj Experience" seems hard to top--- and then to craft and organize the site precisely. The aim is to showcase my very best work, to really give the best experiences I can offer, to offer channels of connection to my work and to me, or at least to "Ajai Raj." 

To that end, the elements (in no particular order)

1\. Writings--- divided into subsections: Essays/Aphorisms/News Stories/Science News Stories/Etc (Any and all work that you're proud of and want to represent you)

2\. Standup--- again, the very best clips. Maybe one set.

3\. Music--- The Single!!! and eventually tour dates, etc

4\. Bio--- important! Get help doing this or give it a lot of attention and several revisions

5\. Schedule--- show calendar

6\. The Ajai Raj Noncast--- feed for the noncast, duh.

TL;DR, site's gonna be dope, gonna buy the domain and then leave to go sing David Bowie in a choir byeeeeeeeee~
